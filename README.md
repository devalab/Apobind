You'd find that the folders with apo structures would have the following files:

*_protein.pdb - the original holo protein structure
*_apo.pdb - apo protein structure
*_apo_added.pdb - apo protein structure with missing residues added
*_protein_nowat.pdb - holo protein structure with water molecules removed
*_ligand.sdf - crystal pose structure of the ligand

There's also "apobind_all.csv" that contains more information about apo-holo pairs in the dataset.
